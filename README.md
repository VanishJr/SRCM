# Project Title
Student report card management system

## Description
This is a basic C++ program that allows the user to input student information such as roll number, name, and marks in various subjects. The program then calculates the percentage and grade of the student based on the marks entered. The user can also view, modify, and delete student records, as well as view a class-wide report in tabular format.

## Usage
The program can be run by compiling and executing the main.cpp file on a C++ compiler. The user will be presented with a main menu to select different options such as entering student information, viewing results, and exiting the program.
